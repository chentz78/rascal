# Empty List

.Synopsis
Illegal operation on an empty list.

.Syntax

.Types
`data RuntimeException = EmptyList();`
       
.Usage
`import Exception;` (only needed when `EmptyList` is used in `catch`)

.Details

.Description
Rascal provides many operations and functions on lists, see link:/Rascal#Values-List[list values] 
and link:/Libraries#Prelude-List[list functions].
This error is generated when a function or operation cannot handle the empty list.

Remedies:

* Guard the function or operation with a test on the empty list (link:/Libraries#List-isEmpty[isEmpty]) and 
  take alternative action in that case.
* Catch the `EmptyList` yourself, see link:/Rascal#Statements-TryCatch[try catch].


.Examples

Import the `List` library and introduce `L` with an empty list as value:
[source,rascal-shell,error]
----
import List;
L = [];
----
Taking the head of an empty list gives an error:
[source,rascal-shell,continue,error]
----
head(L);
----
This is the case when taking the tail as well:
[source,rascal-shell,continue,error]
----
tail(L);
----
We can also catch the `EmptyList` error. First import the Rascal exceptions (which are also included in `Prelude`)
and `IO`:
[source,rascal-shell,continue,error]
----
import Exception;
import IO;
try println(head(L)); catch EmptyList(): println("Cannot take head of empty list");
----
