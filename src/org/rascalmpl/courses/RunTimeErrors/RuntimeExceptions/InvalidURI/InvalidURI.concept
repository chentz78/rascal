# Invalid URI

.Synopsis
An invalid URI is created at runtime.

.Types
`data RuntimeException = InvalidURI(str uri);`
       
.Usage
`import Exception;` (only needed when `InvalidURI` is used in `catch`)

.Description
Thrown by operations on link:/Rascal#Values-Location[source locations] that would 
lead to an invalid URI part of a source location value.

.Examples

[source,rascal-shell,error]
----
someLoc = |home:///abc.txt|;
someLoc.scheme = "a:b";
----

Another well-known example is a missing path when using `//` (wrong) instead of `///` (good):
[source,rascal-shell,error]
----
|home:///|;
|home://|;
