.Description

Rascal can generate various kinds of exceptions and errors during execution (run time):

* <<Runtime Exceptions>> are discovered during execution of the Rascal program and can be caught by the Rascal program.
  When a runtime exception is not caught in the program, execution is aborted.
* <<Other Runtime Errors>> are discovered during execution of the Rascal program and cannot be caught by the Rascal program.
  They always lead to abortion of execution.
