link:/Rascal#Values-DateTime[datetime] values may contain two components: date and time.
Datetime values that contain both a date and a time can be compared.
Dates can also be compared with dates, and times with times.
This error is generated when a date is compared with a time.

.Examples
Comparing dates with dates:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
$2013-07-15$ < $2014-07-15$
----
Or times with times:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
$T20:03:56.901+01:00$ < $T22:00:56.901+01:00$
----
Or datetimes with datetimes:
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
$2013-01-11T23:03:56.901+01:00$ < $2013-01-11T23:05:00.901+01:00$
----
But mixing dates and times gives errors:
[source,rascal-shell,error]
----
$2013-07-15$ < $T20:03:56.901+01:00$
