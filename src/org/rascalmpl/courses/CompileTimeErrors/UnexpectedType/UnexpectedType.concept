.Description
This error signals an incompatibility between expected type and actual type.
Some of the situations in which this may occur are
link:/Rascal#Statements-Assert[assert], link:/Rascal#Declarations-Variable[variable],
link:/Rascal#Statements-Solve[solve].

Remedy: adjust the actual type to the expected type.

.Examples
Declaring variable `n` as `int` and assigning it a `str` value gives an error:
[source,rascal-shell,error]
----
int n = "abc";
----
The solution is to assign an `int` value to `n`:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
int n = 123;
----
An `assert` statement expects an argument of type `bool`:
[source,rascal-shell,error]
----
assert 3;
----
