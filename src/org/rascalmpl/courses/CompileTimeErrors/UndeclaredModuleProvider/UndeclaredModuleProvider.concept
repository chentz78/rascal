.Description

link:/Rascal#Values-Location[Locations] provide very flexible ways to access files and external data sources.
There any many protocols (called _schemes_) that can be used (e.g., `file`, `http`, `home` and many others).
This error is generated when an unknown scheme is used.

Remedy: Use an existing scheme.

.Examples
Misspelling the scheme for Rascal's standard library (which is `std`) gives an error when the location is used:
[source,rascal-shell,error]
----
import IO;
readFileLines(|standard:///demo/basic/Hello.rsc|);
----
This is fixed by using the proper scheme name:
[source,rascal-shell,continue,error]
----
readFileLines(|std:///demo/basic/Hello.rsc|);
----
