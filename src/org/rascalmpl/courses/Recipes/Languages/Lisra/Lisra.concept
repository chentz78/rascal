.Description

Writing a Lisp interpreter is a classical challenge. 
Popular word has that all large applications evolve until they include a Lisp interpreter.
(A variant says the same about including an email client in every large application).

We will closely follow and *reuse parts of* Peter Norvig's excellent page
on http://norvig.com/lispy.html[Lispy], a Lisp interpreter written in Python.
The Lisp variant to be implemented is the following subset of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)[Scheme]
 language:

|===
| Form | Syntax | Semantics and Example

| http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.1.1[variable reference]
| _var_
| A symbol is interpreted as a variable name;
  its value is the variable's
  value. Example: `x`
  
| http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.1.2[constant literal]
| _number_
| A number evaluates to itself. Example: `12`
       
| http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.1.2[quotation]
| `(quote _exp_)`
| Return the _exp_ literally; do not evaluate it. Example:
  `(quote (a b c)) =>; (a b c)`

| http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.1.5[conditional]
| `(if _test conseq alt_)`
| Evaluate _test_; if true,
  evaluate and return _conseq_; otherwise evaluate and return 
  _alt_. <br>Example: `(if (< 10 20) (+ 1 1) (+ 3 3)) => 2`

| http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.1.6[assignment]
| `(set! _var exp_)`
| Evaluate _exp_ and assign that value to
  _var_, which must have been previously defined (with a
  `define` or as a parameter to an enclosing procedure).
   Example: `(set! x2 (* x x))`
   
| http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-8.html#%_sec_5.2[definition]
| `(define _var_ _exp_)`
| Define a new variable in the innermost environment and give it
  the value of evaluating the expression _exp_. 
  Examples: `(define r 3)` _or_ `(define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))`

| http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.1.4[procedure]
| `(lambda (_var..._) _exp_)`
| Create a procedure
  with parameter(s) named _var..._ and the expression as the body.
  Example: `(lambda (r) (* r r))`
  
| http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.2.3[sequencing]
| `(begin _exp..._)`
| Evaluate each of the expressions in left-to-right order, and return the final value.
  Example: `(begin (set! x 1) (set! x (+ x 1)) (* x 2)) => 4
  
| http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-7.html#%_sec_4.1.3[procedure call]
| `(_proc exp..._)`
| If _proc_ is
   anything other than one of the symbols `if`, `set!`, `define`,
   `lambda`, `begin`, or `quote` then it is treated as a procedure.  It is
   evaluated using the same rules defined here. All the expressions
   are evaluated as well, and then the procedure is called with the list
   of expressions as arguments. 
   Example: <`(square 12) => 144
|===

In this table, _var_ must be a symbol--an identifier such as x or square--and number must be an integer number, 
while the other italicized words can be any expression. The notation _exp_... means zero or more repetitions of _exp_.

A Lisp interpreter consists of the following parts:

*  A _parser_ that reads a Lisp program in text form and converts it to a runtime representation that is suitable for the interpreter.
*  The _interpreter_ itself that executes the program in runtime representation and computes its outcome.
*  A _pretty printer_ that converts the outcome in internal representation back to text.
*  Finally, an interactive  _console_ is needed that interact with the user.
