.Description

Graphs are represented as relations. So in general the idea is to use the `Relation` module to manipulate graphs.
At the same time there are algorithms and analyses which make particular sense when we view a relation as a graph, hence the
existence of the `Graph` and `LabeledGraph` libraries.
