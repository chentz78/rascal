.Description
The RascalTutor is an interactive <<Authoring>> and learning environment intended to create and follow interactive courses related to the Rascal language.
It is based on the following principles and ideas:

* The basic notion is a <<Concept>>. Each concept has a _name_ and contains a fixed set of subsections that describe it.
* A course is a _concept tree_:
  The central subject of the course is the root of the concept tree, and all subtrees further explain their parent concept.


A _student_ using a course can:

* Browse through the table of contents of the concept tree of the course.
* Search for concepts and specific terms using a search box.
* Read individual concepts.
* Follow links to other concepts.

An _author_ of a course can:

* Create a new course.
* Create a new concept in a course.
* Edit a concept directly using a standard text editor.
* Add code examples that are actually executed when the concept is turned into an HTML page.
* Recompile the course.
* Inspect the warnings that are generated for the whole course in order to 
  control the quality of the concept descriptions.

The actual markup used is an extension of _AsciiDoc_, see http://asciidoctor.org and
in most cases we directly refer to 

* http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/
* http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/
