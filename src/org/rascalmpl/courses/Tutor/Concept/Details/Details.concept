.Description
To fully describe a concept, subconcepts (or details) are needed.
When the `Details` section is empty, subconcepts will be listed

This alphabetical order can be influenced by explicitly stating concepts in the details sections.
The effect is that the concepts listed there will be shown first, followed by the unmentioned subconcepts
in alphabetical order.

.Examples
