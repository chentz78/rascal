.Description

Recall that a concept is known under two names, its _concept name_ (the file name of the concept) and its _display name_ (the name as displayed in the text).

The first two forms create a link to a concept in the current course.

The remaining two forms create a link to a concept in another course.

The first creates a link to a complete course, the second to a specific concept in an external course.


.Examples

The concept name of this concept is `ReferenceToConcept` while its display name is `Reference to Concept` (note the spaces).

We can create a reference to the `InlineMarkup` concept in the current course in the following ways:

* `\<<Inline Markup>>` (using the display name) gives <<Inline Markup>>.
* `\<<Markup-InlineMarkup>>` (using its parent concept name and concept name) gives <<Markup-InlineMarkup>>.
* `\link:/Tutor#Markup-InlineMarkup[see inline markup]` gives link:/Tutor#Markup-InlineMarkup[see inline markup]

Here is a reference to another course:

* `\link:/Rascal#Statements-If[If statement]` gives link:/Rascal#Statements-If[If statement].

.Benefits

.Pitfalls
Note the `/` before the course name in refernces to another course.
