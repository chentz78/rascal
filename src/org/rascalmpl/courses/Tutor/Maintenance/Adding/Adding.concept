.Description

There are basically two scenarios for adding a new concept, depending on where its contents come from.
If the concept is part of the course (i.e. it is now a remote concept, see below):

* Select a concept that is suitable as parent for the new concept.
* Create a subdirectory, say `SubConcept` for the new subconcept.
* Create the file `SubConcept/SubConcept.concept` using your favourite editor.
* Add the name and other information about the new concept.
* Save the file.


If the concept involves remote content (i.e., the concepts are described in rascallibrary files),
then a <<Remote Concept Mapping>> has to be added as explained in <<Source Code Markup>>.
