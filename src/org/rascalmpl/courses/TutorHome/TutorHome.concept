# Welcome to the Rascal Tutor


include::../tutor-overview.include[]

[WARNING]
====
This course material has been updated for the latest, 
compiler-based, version of Rascal. The same language is supported, but
compared with the older, interpreter-based,
version there are some known differences in:

* Error messages.
* Commands for the RascalShell.
* Not yet supported (mostly Eclipse-related) libraries.
* Names of Exceptions.
