.Description
A reducer resembles the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)[fold] function
found in most functional languages.

A reducer is equivalent to the following code:
[source,rascal,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
it = _InitExp_; // <1>
for(_Gen~1~_, _Gen~2~_, ... ) // <2>
    it = _RedExp_; // <3>
it; // <4>
----
and is executed as follows:

<1> A fresh variable `it` is initialized with _InitExp_. 
    We call the variable `it` since we use `it` to initialize the reducer, to make changes to `it`,
    and to return `it` as result.
<2> A for loop iterates over all values produced by the generators `_Gen~1~_`, `_Gen~2~_`, ... .
<3> In the body of the loop, variable `it` is updated to reflect a new reduced value.
    Note that `it` itself and variables introduced in _Gen_~1~, _Gen_~2~, ... may occur in _RedExp_.
<4> The value of `it` is the result of the reducer.

.Examples
[source,rascal-shell]
----
L = [1, 3, 5, 7];
(0 | it + e | int e <- L);
(1 | it * e | int e <- L);
