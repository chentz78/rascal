.Description
A list is an ordered sequence of values and has the following properties:

*  All elements have the same static type.
*  The order of the elements matters.
*  A list may contain an element more than once.


The type of a list has the form `list[_T_]`,
where `_T_` is an arbitrary type.

When a value or variable of type list occurs inside a list, that list value is inserted as list element.
To achieve _splicing_ of these elements, i.e., the insertion of the elements of the list value rather than the whole list,
it has to be prefixed by the splice operator `*`.

The following operators are provided on list:
loctoc::[1]

There are also link:/Libraries#Prelude-List[library functions] available for List.

.Examples
[source,rascal-shell]
----
[1, 2, 3];
[<1,10>, <2,20>, <3,30>];
[1, "b", 3];
[<"a",10>, <"b",20>, <"c",30>];
[["a", "b"], ["c", "d", "e"]];
----
List splicing works as follows: by prefixing `L` by the splice operator, its elements are included as elements in the enclosing list:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
L = [1, 2, 3];
[10, L, 20];
[10, *L, 20];
